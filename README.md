### Data visualizattion:  Heatmap Corelation
A heatmap correlation is a graphical representation of a correlation matrix. It uses color to show the strength of the relationship between multiple numerical variables. Red usually indicates a positive correlation, blue a negative correlation, and the intensity of the color represents the strength of the correlation.

In this heatmap it was generated using the seaborn library to visualize the correlations between numerical columns in the 'House Price India.csv' dataset.

### Data visualizattion: 3d Stacked bar plot
A 3D stacked bar plot is a way to visualize data with 3 dimensions. Imagine a regular bar chart, but now each bar can be divided into segments, and these bars are arranged in a 3D space. This helps to show how a quantity is composed of different parts, and how these parts vary across two other categories.

For example, in this plot, 'Price' varies with 'lot area' and 'living area'. Each bar represents a combination of 'lot area' and 'living area', and the height of the bar is the average 'Price'. The bar is then segmented to show how the 'Price' is distributed.
